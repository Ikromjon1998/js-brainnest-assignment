| :----: | :--- |
| A) | Blank HTML document with a script tag.  |
| B) | Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. |
| C) | Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the **playerSelection** and **computerSelection** - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" |
| D) | Return the results of this function call, not console.log() |
| E) | Write a NEW function called **game()**. Call the **playRound** function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end. |
